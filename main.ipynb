Manufacturers, suppliers and others provide what you see here, and we have not verified it. See our disclaimer | The gym is an ideal choice for use in homes and day cares due to its quality construction. It helps to enhance motor skills, encourages independent play and captures the attention of infants and toddlers. Sit & Play The sit and play format combines arch activity play with ball pit format. In this format babies can continue to build on fine and gross motor skills as well as acquiring new skills like early object and color recognition, and basic problem solving. Great Value, Lots Of Play This gym is packed with play. It comes with five activity toys that offer unique textures and sound, which can be positioned in many places on the gym and ball pit. It also comes with 40 balls and a large play mat thats both comfortable and visually stimulating. What is really unique is the pop-up mesh side, which can be used to surround baby during lay and play use, or to create the ball pit play environment. Lay & Play The lay and play format creates a sensory playground for small babies. Babies are surrounded by visually stimulating toys that encourage visual development like tracking. The hanging activities toys also encourage early fine and gross motors skills as babies begin to reach, bat, grab, and kick at interesting toys. These motions make toys sway, jingle, and rattle, which create more visual and auditory stimulation and an entertaining reason to do it again. The large surrounding mat help give baby a comfortable and defined space to play. Ball Pit Play The ball pit format creates a fun zone for busy toddlers. At this stage little ones can move around within the pit and have fun putting the balls and activity toys through the strategically placed holes around the mesh pit. It is a great space and opportunity for parents to continue to build their child?s descriptive language and objection recognition through play.
